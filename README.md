# Aly-s-Cosmic-Scoops
A menu and online ordering page for my cosmic ice-cream shop.

This project is the ordering page for a fictional ice cream shop called Aly's Cosmic Scoops. It gives images and descriptions of our curated ice cream choices,
followed by a brief order form where the customer enters the name of their dessert choice, their first name, and a tip if they choose. Finally, they submit their order using the
"submit order" button. The footer contains a phone number for customers to call with any questions.

For the sake of the Code Louisville Front-End project requirements, the following have been utlized:

1. two media queries which optimize the page for medium and large devices.
    - the media queries adjust the navigation bar, as the mobile 'hamburger' turns to a horizontal list of clickable links across the top of the page.
    - the media queries utilize Flexbox to reorganize the five menu items from the mobile version's single column, to the larger screen's rows.
    
2. option one from the CSS list, which is a navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes. At mobile size, we see a hamburger. At desktop size,
we see a horizontal list of links across the top of the page.

3. option two from the CSS list, which is the use of Flexbox to organize the menu section from a single column at mobile view, to two rows at desktop view.

4. option one from the JavaScript list, which is the "Tell us About Yourself" form. The "first name" field of this form uses JavaScript to validate that the user actually entered
some sequence of digits. If they do not, an alert box appears after pressing "submit", notifying the user that the field must be completed. Additionally, once the user completes
the form appropriately and clicks "submit", an alert box appears stating "Thank you *user*. Your order is being prepared".

5. option two from the JavaScript list, which is the tip calculator. The user enters the price of their dessert and the calculator generates their total after applying a 20% tip.
